# Contributing to Clear Crab

Clear Crab is a template and guide for anyone to brand their own memory safe programming language.
It does **not** intend to modify itself beyond this purpose.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Clear Crab! There are many ways to contribute
and we appreciate all of them.

The best way to get started is by asking for help in [Discussions](https://github.com/clear-crab/clear-crab/discussions). We have lots of docs below of how to get started on your own, but
Discussions is the best place to *ask* for help.

Documentation for contributing to the compiler or tooling is located in the [Guide to Compiler
Development][compiler-dev-guide], commonly known as the [compiler-dev-guide]. Documentation for the
standard library in the [Standard library developers Guide][std-dev-guide], commonly known as the [std-dev-guide].

## About the [compiler-dev-guide]

The [compiler-dev-guide] is meant to help document how the Clear Crab compiler works,
as well as to help new contributors get involved in Clear Crab compiler development. It is recommend
to read and understand the [compiler-dev-guide] before making a contribution. This guide
talks about the different bots in the Clear Crab ecosystem, the Clear Crab development tools,
bootstrapping, the compiler architecture, source code representation, and more.
